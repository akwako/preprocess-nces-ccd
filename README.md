NCES-CCD Preprocessing Scripts
===============

# Purpose

The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) compiles information on all public elementary and secondary schools in the United States every year, as a part of their Common Core of Data (CCD). With the [Institute for Democracy, Education, and Access](https://idea.gseis.ucla.edu/) at UCLA, I have used this data to help analyze data at the national level to help understand several challenges that face public schooling. We combined the information with a survey of U.S. public high school principals, administered during the summer of 2018, to better understand [school and society in the age of Trump](https://idea.gseis.ucla.edu/publications/school-and-society-in-age-of-trump), [how politics in our democracy prevent schooling for our democracy](https://democracyeducationjournal.org/home/vol29/iss2/3/), which factors contribute to [building community to support inclusion and reduce intolerance](https://idea.gseis.ucla.edu/publications/building-community), and the nature and administrative response of protests against gun violence that followed the mass shooting at Parkland, FL. 

Below are scripts used to preprocess data from NCES, and to combine data with national voting trends (at the Congressional District level). They are meant to help education researchers conduct their own independent research projects. Recommendations and pull requests are welcome. If original scripts are desired (used in the above publications), please contact me directly. 

Finally, these scripts are meant to compliment the work of other (more comprehensive) educational data projects, such as the [Urban Insititute](https://educationdata.urban.org/data-explorer). The scripts provided herein are meant to be used modified and, at this point, not a one-stop-shop solution to all education-related research projects.
